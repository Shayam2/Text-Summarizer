More modern algorithms included a higher level of automation.  Some  algorithms  directly  used  image intensities  to drive  an  automated algorithm or minimum costpath  computation  for  vessel  centerline  extraction. Other methods extracted handcrafted features from cardiovascular images and then fed those to a statistical classifier, such as a support vector machine, to perform some form of disease prediction.These  features  generally  described  characteristicssuch as texture and shape. Recently, researchmoved in a new direction, typically referred to asradiomics, in which hundreds or even thousands of  highly  abstract  features  were  automatically extracted from medical images. Subsequently, sta-tistical classifiers have to figure out which features are relevant for the task at hand
